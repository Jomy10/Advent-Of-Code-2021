# Advent-Of-Code-2021
My code for Advent Of Code 2021. Mostly written in Rust as that is what I was learning at the time. 
Be warned, it is quite messy. Also, I am in no means an expert, this is just for fun and to develop my Rust (and other languages eventually) skills.

(me in 2021 just starting to learn Rust) Looking at what other people have come up with, it seems like I still have a lot that I can learn from this language.

After day 10 I decided to make a separate project for each day.
