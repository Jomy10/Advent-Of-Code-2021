# Advent-Of-Code-2021
My code for Advent Of Code 2021. Written in Rust as that is what I am learning at the moment. 
Be warned, it is quite messy. Also, I am in no means an expert, this is just for fun and to develop my Rust skills.

Looking at what other people have come up with, it seems like I still have a lot that I can learn from this language.
